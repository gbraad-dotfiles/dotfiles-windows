Windows dotfiles
================

For Cygwin is use my regular [dotfiles](/gbraad/dotfiles) but removing the powerline symlink (to use powerline.exe) and set the appropriate permissions else the execution is denied.

The .vimrc is used for gVim, but it isn't configured with powerline yet.

The rest is for WSL and Windows Terminal.
